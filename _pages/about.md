`On the ACADEMIC JOB MARKET: I am currently seeking a tenure-track faculty position. You can take a look at my `[CV](https://noman-bashir.github.io/cv/) `and` [Research Statement](https://noman-bashir.github.io/assets/pdf/research_statement.pdf)` for a closer look at my background and contributions. You can also access my `[Teaching Statement](https://noman-bashir.github.io/assets/pdf/teaching_statement.pdf) `and` [Diversity Statement](https://noman-bashir.github.io/assets/pdf/diversity_statement.pdf). `I am always excited to share my work with potential colleagues and collaborators. If your department is hiring or if you are interested in learning more about my work, let's talk!`


I am the [Computing & Climate Impact Fellow](https://impactclimate.mit.edu/people/noman-bashir/) at [MIT Climate & Sustainability Consortium (MCSC)](https://impactclimate.mit.edu/) and a postdoc with [Christina Delimitrou](https://people.csail.mit.edu/delimitrou/Main.html) at MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). 


I work on improving the sustainability of computing and AI. I demonstrate that the status quo approach to computing sustainability, i.e., the lone focus on improving energy efficiency, is insufficient to tackle the emerging dynamics of saturating efficiency gains, exponential growth in computing demand, and electricity availability constraints. To solve this problem, I design systems, algorithms, and metrics that elevate sustainability to a first-class objective in computer system design and operation. 

I have made fundamental contributions to the design of sustainable computer systems through multiple artifacts, such as [EcoVisor](https://noman-bashir.github.io/assets/pdf/asplos2023-ecovisor.pdf), [CarbonContainers](https://noman-bashir.github.io/assets/pdf/socc23_carbon_containers.pdf), [CarbonScaler](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626788), and [WattScope](https://noman-bashir.github.io/assets/pdf/performance23-wattscope.pdf). 
One of [my solutions](https://research.google/pubs/take-it-to-the-limit-peak-prediction-driven-resource-overcommitment-in-datacenters/) to improving resource efficiency in datacenters is deployed on all the **Google** datacenters serving applications such as Google Search, Gmail, and YouTube.

Before joining MIT, I was at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) for 7+ years working with [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/) as a postdoc and completing my PhD in Computer Engineering (2022) at the [Sustainable Computing Lab](https://www.sustainablecomputinglab.io/) with [David Irwin](https://www.davidirwin.info/). During my PhD, I worked as a Student Researcher on [Google's Borg Scheduler](https://research.google/research-areas/distributed-systems-and-parallel-computing/) mentored by [Nan Deng](https://research.google/people/106970/) and [Krzysztof RzÄ…dca](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~krzadca/). I also worked at [VMWare Research Group](https://research.vmware.com/) on Computing Sustainability Benchmarking. 

Before joining UMass, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Advanced Communication Lab](https://adcom.lums.edu.pk/) at [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk/), Pakistan, and Systems & Networks Lab at [NUCES-NU](https://www.nu.edu.pk/), Pakistan. 
I did my MS in Energy Systems Engineering from [Center for Advanced Studies in Energy](https://uspcase.nust.edu.pk/about-us/nust-at-a-glance/) at [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk/), Pakistan and BS in Electrical (Power) Engineering at [UET Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/), Pakistan. 

I take a huge pride academic service and was recognized as one of the top three reviewers at ACM e-Energy'23.
