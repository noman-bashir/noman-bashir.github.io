I am a Research Associate at the [Laboratory for Advanced System Software (LASS)](https://lass.cs.umass.edu/), [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I work with [Prof. Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/). I did my PhD in Computer Engineering (2022) at the [Sustainable Computing Lab](https://www.sustainablecomputinglab.io/), University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I was advised by [Prof. David Irwin](https://www.davidirwin.info/). My research focuses on decarbonizing societal infrastructure including datacenters, edge computing systems, and energy systems.

During my PhD, I worked as a Student Researcher in the [Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing Team at Google Research](https://research.google/research-areas/distributed-systems-and-parallel-computing/), where I was mentored by [Nan Deng](https://research.google/people/106970/) and [Krzysztof RzÄ…dca](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~krzadca/). Our work, published at [EuroSys'21](https://research.google/pubs/pub50175/), represents the default resource overcommitment strategy across all of Google's internal datacenters. I also worked at [VMWare Research Group](https://research.vmware.com/) on Computing Sustainability Benchmarking. 

Prior to joining UMass, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Advanced Communication Lab](https://adcom.lums.edu.pk/) at [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk/), Pakistan, and Systems & Networks Research Lab at [NUCES-NU](https://www.nu.edu.pk/), Pakistan. 
I did my MS in Energy Systems Engineering from [Center for Advanced Studies in Energy](https://uspcase.nust.edu.pk/about-us/nust-at-a-glance/) at [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk/), Pakistan. 
I did my BS in Electrical Engineering <br> at [UET Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/), Pakistan.
